Dear Abigail,

I completed this experiment a little differently, but I still accomplished the goal of this experiment. The timing of my experiment was a little off. I wanted to see the results of this experiment to a greater extent, so I let the rubber band stretchhard around three books measuring 5 inches tall by 13 inches wide.   
Definitely feels stretchier than the duplicate of the original I have!
Talk about hwat book you wrapped it around.
