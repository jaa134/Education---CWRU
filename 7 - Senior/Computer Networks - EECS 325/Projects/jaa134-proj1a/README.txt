*** My articles do no have links. Instead, I was searching for academic articles and 
*** downloaded their corresponding pdf's. The links I found redirect to a page that downloads 
*** the PDF. Is it possible to combine my 1st and 2nd choice and do a review of both for
*** project 1b? I'd like to compare and contrast WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3.
